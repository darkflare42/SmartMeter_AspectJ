The System is comprised of 3 major components
1) The Database which holds permanent information regarding the meters
2) The management software which allows the user to interact with the DB and meters with ease
3) A meter simulator - this is a simple program which just simulates interaction with an actual meter, not much else
We should also probably do some simple GUI but that should be the last part, the base has to be created first

Supposedly the interaction with the DB should be using a module named DBInteraction - just a static class
that allows reading and writing values to the DB, maybe running some queries also

Supposedly the interaction with the meter simulator should also have its own module named MeterComm - again a static
class that interacts with the simulator using a simple UDP protocol
